# In the original, naive implementation of the multinomial logit likelihood, we just calculated exp(util) / sum(exp.(utils))
# but this can lead to overflow when util is large. This didn't seem to affect convergence, somehow, but is
# still undesirable. Now we use the logsumexp function from LogExpFunctions which avoids overflow.
